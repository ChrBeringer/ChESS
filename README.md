## What is ChESS Py?
ChESS Py (Chemical Similarity Suite for Python) is an open-source package for the analysis, visualization and processing of chemical similarity relationships. The suite provides a centralized collection of tools for investigating molecular similarities in compound sets, supporting structure elucidation, data exploration and structure-activity relationships.

## ‚ú® Features
- Calculation of structural and topological fingerprints
- Similarity measures & metrics (Tanimoto, Dice, Cosine, etc.)
- Substance comparison in sets and clusters
- Tools for the analysis of chemical neighborhoods and similarity networks
- Integration with chemical formats and standard libraries (RDKit, etc.)
- Output formats for visualization and export

## üì¶ Areas of application
e.g....
- QSAR/QSPR modeling
- Cluster analysis in chemical libraries
- Structure-activity hypotheses
- Data exploration in substance databases


##üõ†Ô∏è Installation
